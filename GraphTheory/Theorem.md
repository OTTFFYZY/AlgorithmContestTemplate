## Handshaking Lemma

Every finite undirected graph has an even number of vertices with odd degree.
$$
\sum _ {v \in V} deg(v) = 2|E|
$$

$$
\sum _ {v \in V} deg(v)[deg(v)\%2==1] = 2k \quad (k \in N)
$$



### For k-ary tree

$$
L=(k-1)*I+1
$$

L: number of leaf nodes

I: number of internal nodes



### For binary tree

$$
L=T+1
$$

L: number of leaf nodes

T: number of nodes with two children
